# CarDetection-iOS

"Car Detection" is trained in Keras using Tensorflow as back-end. It's taking an image as input and it gives a binary 
decision whether a car is present in the image or not. Both Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and Dense Neural Network(DNN) 
are used in the project. After train, converting the .h5 model into .mlmodel to use in Xcode.
